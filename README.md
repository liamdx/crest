# crest-template

## Will form basis for other C++ graphics and engine related projects

## currently intended as a minimal framework for building engine with some boring stuff already linked and setup (e.g. GLEW, GLFW, yse, Assimp etc.)

## also used as a starting point for learning the maths behind 3d game tech.


To get this up and running, once the project is loaded, retarget the solution to your windows version. drag the assimp and libyse dll into the bin/Debug/Win32 folder the first time you launch.
